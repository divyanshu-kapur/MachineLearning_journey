# Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey! This repository serves as a platform to showcase my projects and learning path in the exciting field of Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). Here, you'll find projects demonstrating my understanding of various concepts, including data analysis, visualization, linear regression, and logistic regression.

## Key Technologies and Skills

* Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn (core ML algorithms), TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning)
* Data Analysis and Visualization: pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (numerical operations), matplotlib, seaborn (data visualization)
* Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Data cleaning, transformation, feature selection
* Model Building and Evaluation: Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC...)

## Current Projects

1. **Heart Disease Prediction (Logistic Regression):**
    - Predicts the presence/absence of heart disease using patient data.
    - Explores data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques.
    - Provides insights into risk factors for heart disease.
2. **Ames Housing Prediction (Linear Regression - ElasticNet):**
    - Explores using ElasticNet regularization for housing price prediction.
    - Analyzes factors affecting housing prices.
3. **Advertisement Prediction (Simple Linear Regression):**
    - Demonstrates predicting advertisement click-through rates using linear regression.
    - Focuses on the relationship between features and customer clicks.
4. **Fandango Movies Rating (Data Visualization):**
    - Explores data visualization techniques to understand movie ratings.
    - Creates informative visualizations to analyze trends and patterns.
5. **Tic Tac Toe - Python:**
    - A classic game implemented using Python to showcase basic programming concepts.
